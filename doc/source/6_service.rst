Query service

You can prepare your own knowledge base and build your own KoPL engine to implement complex question answering. You can also use our `query service <https://viskop.xlore.cn/>`_ to start your KoPL journey quickly.

Our KoPL engine is based on `Wikidata15k <https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/ea83c57d262b4a09ab92/?dl=1>`_ .
