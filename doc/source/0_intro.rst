KoPL: Knowledge oriented Programming Language
================================================================

KoPL stands for Knowledge oriented Programing Language. It is designed to provide a unified semantic representation for the semantics of natural language questions requiring complex reasoning. KoPL can represent natural language questions into combination of 27 knowledge operators. The execution of KoPL on a knowledge base will produce the answer to the natural question.

Currently, KoPL has a broad coverage on diverse knowledge elements, such as concepts, entities, relations, attributes, and qualifiers. KoPL also supports many different type of questions, such as counting, verification, and comparison. KoPL provides transparent reasoning process, and is easy to understand and use.

The designing principle of KoPL is:

- Preserving explicit and transparent reasoning process
- Easy to understand and user-friendly.
- Supporting diverse knowledge sources, including not only knowledge base but also text.
